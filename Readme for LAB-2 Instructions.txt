The lab-2 is a torso walking simiulation
I have used quaternions,fixed angles for angle types and catmullRom,Bspline for interpolation
I have made an extension that the torso will face in which direction is is moving to give correct walking experinece
Feel free to give your own inputs by changing the values in the input.txt file

the input will follow as
line-1 dt(what ever value you give divide it with 1000 before giving like 16==> 0.016)
line-2 Number of Keyframes n
Line-3 Spline type(CatMullRom, Bspline)
Line-4 Angle type(Fixed, Quaternion)
the rest lines for the keyframes

The rotation matrix will be generated by calculating the direction of the torso in which it is moving and the translation is done by rotation matrix
Since the walking is happening in XZ-plane the rotation along Y is taken care by the direction in which the torso is walking
So by the above the fixed angles/qauternions rotational matrix values are not calculated
